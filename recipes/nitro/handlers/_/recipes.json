Reserve  cup of the berries for garnish. Put the 3 cups of blackberries, the powered sugar and the lemon juice in a food processor and pure. Pour the pure into a bowl and set aside.</li><li>Pre-heat oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Take a full size sheet pan and line it with a silpat mat. (If you dont have one, use parchment paper sprayed with Pam cooking spray) Get a large pastry bag with a star tip ready. Put the granulated sugar in a food processor and blitz into a very fine powder, about a minute. Transfer the superfine sugar to a bowl. Add the confectioners sugar and the chocolate to the food processor and process until the chocolate is pulverized into tiny flecks. Transfer to a bowl. Pour the egg whites into a mixing bowl and beat at slow speed with a whisk attachment until the egg whites begin to froth, then add the cream of tartar. Increase the speed to high and beat the whites until they form stiff peaks. Add the superfine sugar and continue to beat for another two minute</li><li>Using a spatula, fill the pastry bag with the egg white mixture and pipe out the meringue kisses onto the lined baking sheet. As you finish squeezing out a dollop of egg white, gently push the star tip of the pastry bag into the dollop about  inch and then quickly pull it away: that action gives the top a small point.</li><li>When all the meringues are piped out, place the baking sheet in the oven for an hour-and-a half. Youre not baking the meringues, but simply drying out the egg whites. Theyre done when the meringue is hard to the touch. Remove the meringues from the oven and let cool to room temperature.</li><li>To plate and serve, spoon several tablespoons of blackberry sauce into the center of a bowl, add 3 0r 4 pear quarters, several meringue kisses, and garnish with a few whole blackberries.</li></ol>"},{"id":652332,"title":"Monastery soup","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/652332-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":4,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/Y67R5WMP/monastery-soup","summary":"Monastery soup is a <b>gluten free, dairy free, lacto ovo vegetarian, and vegan</b> recipe with 4 servings.
